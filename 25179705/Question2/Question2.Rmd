# Answer 

## Part 1 



It’s time to finally settle the age-old debate: Coldplay vs. Metallica.


```{r Figure12, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Battle of The Best \\label{Figure12}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

coldplay  <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Coldplay_vs_Metallica", "Coldplay.csv")) %>%  rename(album = `album_name`)
metallica <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Coldplay_vs_Metallica", "metallica.csv"))
spotify <- read_rds(here::here("data", "Coldplay_vs_Metallica", "Broader_Spotify_Info.rds"))
billboard_100 <- read_rds(here::here("data", "Coldplay_vs_Metallica", "charts.rds"))


code_files <- list.files(here::here("code"), pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE)
invisible(lapply(code_files, source))

plot_album_comparison(data1 = coldplay , data2 = metallica)
```
As a basketball fan, I’ve often wondered who would win in their prime, LeBron or Jordan. You can only truly compare greatness when both are at their best. That’s the spirit behind Table \ref{Figure12}, which compares the most popular albums from each band.

The boxplot reveals that Coldplay holds a slightly higher median track popularity than Metallica. Notably , Coldplay boasts more popular songs, with Yellow claiming the top overall spot. Further this shows that there is large variance in the popularity of Parachutes, some hits and some misses. However , 72 seasons just seems to be an above average album. 


Upon examining the data , I noticed the wide range in the duration of Metallica songs , could this be partly why their songs tend to be less popular or could this reveal a strong positive relationship between the length of songs and their popularity. 



<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->








```{r Figure54, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Relationship Between Duration and Popularity \\label{Figure54}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.
code_files <- list.files(here::here("code"), pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE)
invisible(lapply(code_files, source))

duration(data1 = coldplay, data2= metallica)


  


```

Figure \ref{Figure54} illustrates that there is a relatively flat trend between the duration of Metallica songs and their popularity , showing that listeners of this band are indifferent to the length of the song. However, the figure shows that most songs hover around the low to middle popularity scores irrespective of duration. In contrast, figure \ref{Figure54} shows that Coldplay's most popular songs tend to be mid-length, with popularity gradually declining as track duration increases.

One might say : I want to enjoy the song for as long as possible. This statement ignores the fact that many times we listen to music to make us happy and to socialise, so a prolonged song might just ruin the mood. The next figure compares the danceability of Metallica and Coldplay songs. 

```{r Figure60, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = " Danceability Comparison \\label{Figure60}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

 code_files <- list.files(here::here("code"), pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE)
invisible(lapply(code_files, source))


dannce_plot(data=coldplay, data2 = metallica)

```
 

Figure \ref{Figure60}  shows that Metallica that most of Metallica's songs have a low danceability , further the narrow range indicates that this is a theme for most of their songs , not surprising given that they are a heavy-metal band. In contrast, Coldplay songs have a wide variety of danceability , this shows the ability of the artists to appeal to different preferences. With this distribution slightly shifted to the right we conclude that Coldplay songs have on average a higher danceability. 

That got me thinking, can we take these findings and extrapolate them to the broader music industry?

\newpage

```{r Figure3, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = " Trend In Danceable Music  \\label{Figure3}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}



code_files <- list.files(here::here("code"), pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE)
invisible(lapply(code_files, source))


danu(data = spotify)
```

Figure \ref{Figure3} shows that over time, average danceability in music actually declined for a while. I'm a firm believer that artists follow what listeners want, so maybe Metallica and Coldplay aren’t the best examples to base this on. Interestingly, just before 2000, we see a shift : danceability starts to rise again, and that upward trend has continued, suggesting a clear change in listener preferences.
