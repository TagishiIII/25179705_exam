# Answer
## Part 1 


To help the New York-based agency make a well-informed  decision about naming its toy, Iâ€™ve included a Spearman correlation plot below. This shows how the top 25 baby names persist over a three-year span, offering insight into which names are likely to remain popular long enough for the agency to capitalize on current naming trends and make the most profits. 

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)

 

Top_100_Billboard <- read_rds(here::here("data", "US_Baby_names", "charts.rds"))

Baby_Names <- read_rds(here::here("data", "US_Baby_names", "Baby_Names_By_US_State.rds"))

HBO_titles <-read_rds(here::here("data", "US_Baby_names","HBO_titles.rds"))

HBO_credits <- read_rds(here::here("data", "US_Baby_names","HBO_credits.rds"))

code_files <- list.files(here::here("code"), pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE)
invisible(lapply(code_files, source))

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->


```{r Figure1, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Correlation between each year's rankings and the next 3 years \\label{Figure1}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
 
spear1(data = Baby_Names)

  

```


The Spearman correlation results in \ref{Figure1} show that the strongest relationship is consistently between a given year and the year immediately following it. This indicates that the top baby names remain stable for at least one year. Further, as the years progress we see a gradual decline , indicating that naming trends typically shift within a few years. However, we see period of peaks and troughs indicating that there are other reasons that affect the persistence of names. Lastly , the evidence indicates that male names tend to persist for a longer duration. 


A colleague of mine noted that there was a spike for the name Katina in 1974 , a character on the show ' Where The Heart Is'. To table below adds robustness to \ref{Figure1} , testing whether the decay of trends is inevitable irrespective of the size of the name spike. 

```{r ShortTable, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)


  print(
      xtable(
    get_spearman_for_year(data = Baby_Names, y = 1974, g = "F") %>%
      dplyr::mutate(
        Year = as.integer(Year),
        Future_Year = as.integer(Future_Year)
      ),
    caption = "Persistence of Female Names \\label{tab1}"
  ),
  include.rownames = FALSE,
  caption.placement = "bottom",
  comment = FALSE
)

```


Table \ref{tab1} supports the findings from the Spearman correlation analysis. Although there was a huge spike in the popularity of the name Katina in 1974, the overall trend mirrors that observed for male names,  gradual decline over time. Nevertheless, there remains evidence of moderate persistence in certain names.
