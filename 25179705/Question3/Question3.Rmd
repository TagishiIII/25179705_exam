# Introduction \label{Introduction}

I am helping another billion dollar company stay rich. 


## Part 1

Netflix being an international company has to cater for the likes of a wide range of people , to help make them alter the algorithm in certain regions in a more effective wqy.  I have identified the five highest-rated genres by production country. The following illustration presents this analysis:

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Top Genre by Production Country \\label{Figure1}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.

uno(data= Titles , top_n_genres =5, top_n_countries =5)

```

Figure \ref{Figure1} shows that production countries based in EG , KW and GB all have 'comedy, drama' as their top- rated genre. The average IMDb score of these countries is just below 8 indicating that audiences really approve of not only the genre mix but the execution of these production countries. Further , we see that the top rated genre for Indian producers is documentaries , and for Spain and Argentina it drama. However , it is evident that the overwhelming favorite is the 'comedy , drama' mix. 


With an inexhaustible list of movies available , Netflix aims to select a mix of movies and shows that the audiences will respond well to. A key consideration in this process is whether viewers are more responsive to older or newer titles. The analysis below explores this question.

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Trend of IMDb Scores \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}


trend(data = Titles)


# Although the functions above are really simple, the principle is simple: containing calculations and data wrangling in their own functions will make this template much cleaner and more manageable.
# When you start working, delete these meaningless functions and replace with your own...

```

Figure \ref{Figure2} shows that a decline in average IMDb scores movies and shows released in the period between 1970 and 1980 , with the average score picking up in the late nighties with some classics that still make me laugh until the average IMDb scores peaked around 2010 and since has been on the decline once more. Simply put , Netflix we need more 90s classics. From a business standpoint, many individuals of working age likely view the 1990s with a sense of nostalgia. Capitalizing on this sentiment could be a key to higher retention.

## Part 2 

A select group of directors have gained popularity for their longevity and consistent output in film and television production. Among them is Marcus Raboy, best known for directing Friday After Next. As illustrated in Figure \ref{Figure3}, he holds the highest number of titles available on the Netflix platform. However, this raises an important question ,  does this superior performance compared to others in the top 10? 

```{r Figure3, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Most Prolific Directors \\label{Figure3}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

top_director(data1 = Titles , data2 = Movie_Info)




```
To address the question I have posed , the density plot below offers valuable means of examining the distribution of IMDb scores and clarifying any uncertainty. 

```{r Figure4, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Density Plot of Top 5 Directors \\label{Figure4}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

top_producer_facet(data1= Titles , data2 = Movie_Info)




```

Figure \ref{Figure4} shows that the stand out director is Jay Karas who on average produces the highest-rated content amongst the top 5 most prolific directors. While Marcus Raboy's content spans a range, most of his titles fall into the solidly average-to-good category. Notably, Jay Chapman shows the highest level of consistency in the ratings of his content, with a narrowly concentrated distribution centered around the upper to mid range of the IMDb scale.
