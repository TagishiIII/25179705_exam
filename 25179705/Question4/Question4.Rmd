# Introduction

You know what they say, the rich get richer. Letâ€™s take a look at the wealth patterns in the world



## Part 1

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Billionaire Comparison \\label{Figure1}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.


Billions <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Billions","billionaires.csv")) %>% arrange(desc(company.founded))

code_files <- list.files(here::here("code"), pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE)

invisible(lapply( list.files(here::here("code"), pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE),source))

firstplot(data = Billions , Title = "Billionaires : Inherited Wealth ( USA vs Rest of World") 


```

Kudos to the Americans , they have really created an economy that conducive for generating Uber wealth. Unfortunately, the notion held that those who are rich in America are only hard-nosed workaholics who built businesses from scratch, while the rest of the world's billionaires inherit their wealth , is simply not true. 


Figure \ref{Figure1} shows that the Rest of the World has more self-made billionaires than the USA, yes the rest of the world has more billionaires who have inherited that wealth too, but we see that both can be true. Surely one might surmise that this hold purely  based on the fact that the Rest of the World has more people than the USA , the next figure will address that thought. 


Table \ref{tab1} shows that over two-thirds of American billionaires over the history of time are self-made, dispelling any false notions that there is an entrepreneurial gene. Another noteworthy figure is the number of those who inherited via 5th generation or longer, as this family has been through depressions , recessions and  yet maintains billionaire status.

```{r ShortT, results = 'asis'}


library(dplyr)
library(xtable)


print(
  xtable(us_inheritance_table(data = Billions) , caption = "USA Billionaires by Inheritance Status \\label{tab1}"),
  include.rownames = FALSE,
  caption.placement = "bottom" , comment = FALSE ,
)




```

Looking at Table \ref{tab2} we see that the rest of the world has a slightly lower percentage of self-made billionaires at 63.8% . This is a narrative that the Americans are running with and I hate to be the one to confirm it. 


```{r , results = 'asis'}

library(dplyr)
library(xtable)



print(
  xtable(non_us_inheritance_table(data = Billions), caption = "Rest of the World by Inheritance Status\\label{tab2}"),
  include.rownames = FALSE,
  caption.placement = "bottom" , comment = FALSE 
)




```



\newpage

As quants we aim to steer our clients to invest in companies that are profitable.Table \ref{tab3} uses the number of billionaires associated with a company as a proxy for the profitability of the company , with 4 of the top 5 companies being US based it is no wonder the US is a certified  economic powerhouse.


```{r Sho, results = 'asis'}

library(dplyr)
library(xtable)

print(
  xtable(top5_companies_table(data = Billions) , caption = "Companies With Most Billionaires \\label{tab3}"),
  include.rownames = FALSE,
  caption.placement = "bottom" , comment = FALSE ,
)
    

```


## Part 2 


The year 2000 is widely regarded as the peak of the dot.com bubble  , a period where technology startups saw immense growth and profits. Unfortunately , it came to an end known as the bubble 'burst' in the early 2000, but does that mean incredibly successful tech startups are a thing of the past?


```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Companies founded Since 2000 \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}



Billions <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Billions","billionaires.csv")) %>% arrange(desc(company.founded))

third_plot(data = Billions , Title = "Top 10 Sectors for Self-Made Billionaires ")


# Although the functions above are really simple, the principle is simple: containing calculations and data wrangling in their own functions will make this template much cleaner and more manageable.
# When you start working, delete these meaningless functions and replace with your own...

```


Figure \ref{Figure2} shows that the technology sector remains strongâ€”ranking as the fourth most common source of billionaire-founded companies since 2000. However, it trails behind consumer services type sectors such as pharmaceuticals.




```{r ShortTable, include=FALSE, results='asis'}

library(xtable)
data <- mtcars[1:5,] %>% tibble::as_tibble()

table <- xtable(data, caption = "Short Table Example \\label{tab1}")
  print.xtable(table,
             # tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H',
             # scalebox = 0.3,
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )

```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
To reference calculations __in text__, _do this:_ From table \ref{tab1} we see the average value of mpg is `r mean(mtcars[1:5,]$mpg)`.

Including tables that span across pages, use the following (note that I add below the table: ``continue on the next page''). This is a neat way of splitting your table across a page.

Use the following default settings to build your own possibly long tables. Note that the following will fit on one page if it can, but cleanly spreads over multiple pages:
```



```{r LongTable, include=FALSE, results='asis'}

library(xtable)

data = mtcars %>% tibble::as_tibble()
  addtorow          <- list()
  addtorow$pos      <- list()
  addtorow$pos[[1]] <- c(0)
  addtorow$command  <- c(paste("\\hline \n",
                               "\\endhead \n",
                               "\\hline \n",
                               "{\\footnotesize Continued on next page} \n",
                               "\\endfoot \n",
                               "\\endlastfoot \n",sep=""))
table <- xtable(data, caption = "Long Table Example")
  print.xtable(table,
             tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = FALSE, # Leave this as is.
             table.placement = 'H', # Leave this as is.
             booktabs = T, # Aesthetics
             include.rownames = FALSE,  # Typically you don't want this in a table.
             add.to.row = addtorow, # For adding the Continued on next page part...
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'top',  # Where do you want the caption?
             size="\\fontsize{12pt}{13pt}\\selectfont"  # Size of text in table..
             )
# See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf for table inspiration
```

<!-- hfill can be used to create a space, like here between text and table. -->

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Huxtable

Huxtable is a very nice package for making working with tables between Rmarkdown and Tex easier.

This cost some adjustment to the Tex templates to make it work, but it now works nicely.

See documentation for this package [here](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html). A particularly nice addition of this package is for making the printing of regression results a joy (see [here](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html#creating-a-regression-table)). Here follows an example:


If you are eager to use huxtable, comment out the Huxtable table in the Rmd template, and uncomment the colortbl package in your Rmd's root.

Note that I do not include this in the ordinary template, as some latex users have complained it breaks when they build their Rmds (especially those using tidytex - I don't have this problem as I have the full Miktex installed on mine). Up to you, but I strongly recommend installing the package manually and using huxtable. To make this work, uncomment the _Adding additional latex packages_ part in yaml at the top of the Rmd file. Then comment out the huxtable example in the template below this line. Reknit, and enjoy.
```



```{r include=FALSE, results='asis'}

if(!require(huxtable)) install.packages(huxtable)
library(huxtable)
data(diamonds, package = 'ggplot2')
Title <- "Regression Output"
Label <- "Reg01"
lm1 <- lm(price ~ carat, diamonds)
lm2 <- lm(price ~ depth, diamonds)
lm3 <- lm(price ~ carat + depth, diamonds)
htab <-
huxreg(lm1, lm2, lm3,
                statistics = c(N = "nobs", R2 = "r.squared"),
                note = "%stars%.") %>%
  set_caption(Title) %>%
  set_label(Label)
# More settings:
font_size(htab) <- 12
# Let's change regression names: this is slightly hacky, but works. Comment out this section to see what the default looks like:
  Names <- c( "Reg1", "Reg2", "Reg3")
  for(i in 1:length(Names)) {
    htab[1,][[1+i]] <- Names[i]
  }
# Now simply call the table:
htab

```
